     <h1>***Homework 14***</h1>
     <h2>Question a. About Project Websites:</h2>
     <p>I used <strong>ChatGPT</strong> as a website development tool for developing my project website.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Question b.</h2>
     <p>There is my project link in my home page and it works.</p><br>
     <h2>Question d.ðŸŒ… Sunset Social Media - New Features Explanation:</h2>
     <p>This summary describes the new features I implemented to enhance the functionality, design, and user experience of my Sunset Social Media website project.</p>
     <div class="feature">
    <h3>1. User Profile Page</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong><br>
     <p>
         I used ChatGPT to help me create a user profile page for my Sunset Social Media website. 
         Described what I wanted â€” a simple profile view with the user's name and welcome message â€” and ChatGPT generated the full HTML and PHP structure. I then customized the styles and added it to my site, linking it from the main page. And, only you can see it (profile) after logging in.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><br>
      This adds a personal touch to the site, lets users manage their presence, and gives them a sense of ownership and identity on the platform.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h3>2. Profile Photo Upload and Display</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong><br>
      Added a feature for users to upload their profile photo during registration, which is then shown on their profile and optionally on comments or posts, and there is an option to delete the post too.</p>

      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><br>
      Makes the platform more personalized, friendly, and modern, increasing engagement through visual identity.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>3. Theme Switcher (Sunset / Twilight / Dark Mode)</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong><br>
      Introduced a dropdown menu that lets users switch between different themes such as Sunset, Twilight, and Dark mode. And, it's on the right side bottom of the page.</p>

      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><br>
      Enhances user comfort, accessibility, and aesthetic preference. It aligns with the overall "sunset" theme of the website.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>4. Sunset Calendar (Global Sunset Times)</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>What I did:</strong><br>
      Integrated a sunset calendar showing sunset times in major global cities, automatically updated with the current date.</p>

      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><br>
      Makes the website more informative and globally relevant. It also deepens the sunset experience by connecting users from different time zones.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Overall Contribution to the Project</h3>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>These features significantly improve the functionality, personalization, and aesthetic value of my Sunset Social Media platform. They enhance user experience by supporting login-based interaction, theme control, visual identity, and time-based global content. Together, these additions align well with the project's sunset theme and create a richer, more engaging environment for users to enjoy and share their moments.</p>
  </div>
