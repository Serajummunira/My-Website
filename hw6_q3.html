    <h1>JavaScript Statements - Answers</h1>

    <!-- Q1 -->
    <div class="answer">
        <div class="question">Q3-a. What is the minimum number of statements in a code block, that is, the stuff typically between the curly braces, as in, {your code here}?</div>
        <p>The minimum number of statements in a code block is 0. An empty code block is valid in JavaScript, meaning you can have an empty set of curly braces with no statements inside.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Q2 -->
    <div class="answer">
        <div class="question">Q3-b. What is the maximum number of statements in a code block?</div>
        <p>There is no strict maximum number of statements in a code block in JavaScript. The number of statements can be as large as needed, depending on the logic of the program and the available memory, though readability may decrease with an excessive number of statements.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Q3 -->
    <div class="answer">
        <div class="question">Q3-c. True or False: The semicolon (";") is a statement separator in JS.</div>
        <p><strong>True.</strong> The semicolon is used to separate statements in JavaScript, although it is optional in some cases due to automatic semicolon insertion (ASI).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Q4 -->
    <div class="answer">
        <div class="question">Q3-d. Must you end a JavaScript statement with a semicolon (";"), or can you use a line break instead?</div>
        <p>You can use a line break instead of a semicolon in many cases due to JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), but it's generally recommended to end statements with a semicolon to avoid unexpected behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Q5 -->
    <div class="answer">
        <div class="question">Q3-e. In English, is the question mark typically a statement separator or a statement terminator?</div>
        <p>A question mark is typically a <strong>statement terminator</strong> in English, marking the end of a question.</p>
    </div>
