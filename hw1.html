    <h1>Q1. Grading Method Discussion</h1>
    <h3>Minimum Score of 50%</h3>
    <p>     
    The minimum score (set at 50%) on assignments is designed to ensure that students stay motivated; however, some may still struggle with the course material. This approach not only helps prevent discouragement, but also supports a growth mindset (because it provides a baseline from which all students can work to improve). Although it may seem stringent, this strategy fosters an environment conducive to learning and personal development.
    </p>
    <h4>Comparison with Past Grading Method</h4>
    <p>
    In my earlier courses, grading was primarily determined by the number of correct answers, with no established minimum score. This frequently resulted in elevated stress levels and feelings of discouragement among students who faced challenges at the outset. However, the minimum score instituted in this course aims to mitigate such issues (which can be detrimental) because it provides a safety net for those who may struggle initially. Although some may argue that this approach could lessen motivation, it is essential to recognize the potential benefits.
