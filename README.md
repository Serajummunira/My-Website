# 🌇 Sunset Social Media Website
This project is a simple social media-style website developed as part of an academic course requirement. It was built and hosted using [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net/), a free web hosting service.

The website allows users to:
- Upload and share sunset images

- View recent posts with visual elements
