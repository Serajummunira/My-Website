    <h3>Reasonable vs. Excluded Causes</h3>
    <h4>Reasonable Causes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Prerequisites not met</li>
        <li>Course is full</li>
        <li>Registration hold (unpaid fees, missing documents)</li>
        <li>System error</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Excluded Causes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Student forgets to register (This is a user issue, not a system failure)</li>
        <li>Internet outage (This is an external factor beyond the system’s control)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suggested Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement a waitlist system for high-demand courses.</li>
        <li>Increase system capacity during peak registration times.</li>
        <li>Send automated prerequisite alerts to students.</li>
        <li>Enhance error messages to provide clearer guidance.</li>
        <li>Introduce a **proactive advising notification system** to flag issues early.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Q-3. 5 Whys Technique Analysis</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Why couldn't the student register?</strong> → The system showed an error message.</li>
        <li><strong>Why did the system show an error?</strong> → The student did not meet a prerequisite.</li>
        <li><strong>Why didn’t the student meet the prerequisite?</strong> → The advising system did not notify them.</li>
        <li><strong>Why didn’t the advising system notify them?</strong> → No automated prerequisite warning.</li>
        <li><strong>Why isn’t there an automated warning?</strong> → The registration system lacks real-time checks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Suggested Fixes Based on 5 Whys</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement real-time prerequisite checking.</li>
        <li>Provide automated alerts if a prerequisite is missing.</li>
        <li>Require advisor approval for exceptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
        The **FMEA analysis** helps identify key failure modes, while the **5 Whys technique** uncovers the root cause. 
        Both approaches highlight the **lack of real-time prerequisite checking** as a major issue.
        The best way to mitigate this risk is to implement **proactive alerts** and **improve system capacity** 
        to ensure students receive timely updates about their eligibility for courses.

     <h1>Q-4. Comparison of 5 Whys and Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)</h1>

    <h2>Applicability and Results</h2>

    <h3>5 Whys Technique</h3>
    <p>The 5 Whys technique is useful for identifying the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking "Why?" until the fundamental issue is uncovered. 
    It is a simple, qualitative method that works well for troubleshooting and solving specific, well-defined issues.</p>

    <p>For example, if students face difficulties in UALR's course registration system, applying the 5 Whys may reveal that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Students are unable to register on time. <strong>Why?</strong></li>
        <li>The registration portal is slow and crashes. <strong>Why?</strong></li>
        <li>The system cannot handle high traffic. <strong>Why?</strong></li>
        <li>The infrastructure has limited server capacity. <strong>Why?</strong></li>
        <li>IT funding for server upgrades is insufficient.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong> The main issue is insufficient IT funding, leading to poor server performance.</p>

    <h3>Failure Mode Effects and Analysis (FMEA)</h3>
    <p>FMEA is a structured, quantitative approach that systematically identifies potential failures, evaluates their severity, likelihood, and detection, and assigns a Risk Priority Number (RPN) to each issue.</p>

    <p>For the same course registration issue, FMEA would involve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> System crashes during peak registration.</li>
        <li><strong>Effects:</strong> Delayed registration, frustrated students, administrative burden.</li>
        <li><strong>Potential Causes:</strong> High traffic, outdated infrastructure, software bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Detection Methods:</strong> Load testing, error logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Priority Number (RPN):</strong> Calculated based on severity, occurrence, and detection ratings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Provides a structured risk assessment, prioritizing system upgrades and preventive actions.</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Complexity</td>
            <td>Easy to apply, requires minimal data.</td>
            <td>Requires data, expertise, and structured evaluation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Best For</td>
            <td>Simple issues with clear causes.</td>
            <td>Complex systems with multiple failure points.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Suitability for Different Problems</h2>

    <p><strong>5 Whys is best for:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quickly diagnosing operational problems.</li>
        <li>Addressing human or process errors.</li>
        <li>Small-scale issues with clear root causes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>FMEA is better suited for:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engineering and technical systems (e.g., software failures).</li>
        <li>Risk management in high-stakes environments (e.g., healthcare, aviation).</li>
        <li>Large-scale processes where multiple failures need prioritization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Both techniques are useful but serve different purposes. 5 Whys is faster and more intuitive, making it ideal for troubleshooting individual problems. 
    FMEA is more structured and effective for large, complex systems that require risk mitigation. 
    For improving UALR’s course registration system, FMEA provides a better long-term solution, while 5 Whys helps in quick diagnostics.</p>
